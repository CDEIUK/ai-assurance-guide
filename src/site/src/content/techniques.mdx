## Understanding the spectrum of assurance techniques

The spectrum of assurance techniques offer different processes for providing assurance, enabling assurance users to have justified trust in a range of subject matter relevant to the trustworthiness of AI systems.

On one end of this spectrum, impact assessments are designed to account for uncertainty, ambiguity and the unobservability of potential future harms. Impact assessments require expertise and subjective judgement to account for these factors, but they enable standardised processes for qualitatively assessing potential impacts. Assurance can be provided against these processes and the mitigation strategies put in place to deal with potential adverse impacts.

Other end of this spectrum, formal verification is appropriate for assessing trustworthiness for subject matters which can be measured objectively and with a high degree of certainty, but is ineffective if the subject matter is ambiguous, subjective or uncertain.

The table below looks at how different assurance techniques interact with the 5 elements of an assurance engagement.
